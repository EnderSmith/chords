      We{E}lcome to my secret la{E:sus4:}ir on Skullcrusher Moun{E}tain. {E:sus4:}
      I h{E}ope that you've enjoyed your st{E:sus4:}ay so far?
      I see you've m{E:7:}et my assistant Scarface.
      His app{A}earance is quite dist{E}urbing,
      But I ass{A}ure you he's harmless en{B:7:}ough.
      He's a sw{A}eetheart, calls me m{E}aster,
      And he has a w{A}ay of f{B:7:}inding pret{A}ty thin{B:7:}gs and bringi{A}ng them to me..{B:7:}.

      Oh, and I'{E}m so into you, but I'm w{Bm}ay too smart for you.
      Even my h{A}enchmen think I'm crazy; I'm not surpr{Am}ised that you agree.
      If you could f{E}ind some way to be a little bit l{Bm}ess afraid of me,
      You'd see the v{A}oices that control me from ins{Am}ide my head
      Say {D7}I shouldn't kill you, yet{(E)}.

I made this half-pony, half-monkey monster to please you,
But I get the feeling that you don't like it.
What's with all the screaming?
You like monkeys; you like ponies...
Maybe you don't like monsters so much?
Maybe I used too many monkeys...
Isn't it enough to know that I ruined a pony making a gift for you?

      You know it isn't easy living here on Skullcrusher Mountain.
      Maybe you could cut me just a little slack --
      Would it kill you to be civil?
      I've been patient, I've been gracious,
      And this mountain is covered with wolves --
      Hear them howling, my hungry children.
      Maybe you should stay and have another drink 
      and think about me and you?
